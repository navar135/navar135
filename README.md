I am Karen Navarro a Ph.D. researcher based in Minneapolis, MN. I have been working in the field of human vision science for more than six years. 

🔭 I am currently developing my dissertation thesis which focuses on how a person's eye dominance changes through repetitive training and the neural correlates responsible for this change. I am looking to transition into industry after I defend my dissertation. 
I focus on analyzing large neuroimaging and behavioral datasets with the goal of understanding how the two eyes work together to create a single percept of the world. I am experienced in: 
- Python
- R
- SQL
- MATLAB
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization

🤔 I am looking for help in transitioning from an academic to an industry career. 

⚡ Fun Fact: I am a recreational weightlifter 🏋🏽 and CrossFit athlete. I recently competed in a scaled competetion and placed 2nd. I love trying new hobbies and activities.
