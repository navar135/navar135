I am Karen Navarro a data scientist based in Minneapolis, MN. 

I recently started my industry data science career working for a personal and commercial insurance company. Before this transition, I had worked in the human vision science for over six years. I focused on analyzing large neuroimaging and behavioral datasets to understand how the two eyes work together to create a single percept of the world. Now I spend most of my time developing risk selection and pricing models. 

 I am experienced in: 
- Python
- R
- MATLAB
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis
- Machine Learning

  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about GenAI and how to integrate these techniques in my work
